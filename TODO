A some items I think would help the importer:

1) Have an option to create a customer and then order from the whois information retreived from enom. So that if a customer account isn't known, at least one can be created. 

2) When selecting the customer for creating an order, have it auto select the best match by searching for the email address of the registrant on file.

3) Ability to filter out domains that already exist in whmcs. 

4) When creating order, have option to disable auto renewal . 

5) Bulk import for item 1
