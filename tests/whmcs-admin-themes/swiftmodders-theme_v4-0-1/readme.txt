========== INSTALLATION/UPGRADE ==========
Installing this theme is very easy, simple follow the steps below to ensure this theme works properly.

*Note: The "upload" folder contains a "modules" folder that features revised widgets for the homepage.  These are REQUIRED to use this theme and make sure you backup the original widgets.

1. Locate the "upload" folder in theme download file.
*Note: If you changed the path to your admin directory, you must upload the files to that directory.

2. Upload those files into your admin directory.

OPTIONAL - How do I change "WHMCS" to my company name?
Navigate to the "templates/swiftmodders-v3" folder in your admin directory and open the header.tpl file.  Within that file search for:

<div class="logo"><a href="index.php">WHMCS</a></div>

*Note: I highly recommend keeping this text.  A picture logo may distort the header completely.

Change the "WHMCS" text to whatever you would like.  Be warned that changing it to a long company name will result in your navigation being shifted down and affecting the visual appearance of the theme on both desktop of mobile devices.
